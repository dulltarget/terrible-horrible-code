Just some silly assembly stuff

; If you for any reason want to try this, (there's nothing to do with it), concatenate the assembled kernel (sector 1+) to the assembled bootloader (sector 0) in a hex editor.
; I may provide a premade .IMG for direct boot by floppy in a VM, so I'll keep you updated

About that file, you can have it now I guess, it does about as much as you'd expect and I refuse to unpad it -.-
