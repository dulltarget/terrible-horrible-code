DOCUMENTATION:

    V0.1.3  | An entire font rendering system, with a simplistic font to match. Programming is now feasible, as 0x40 can be used by any image loaded by LOAD.
    V0.1.2  | LOOK command allows for the viewing of memory at a certain byte in the segment. Added some functional potential (albeit quite rough) to graphical mode. Created INT 0x40.
    V0.1.1  | LOAD command added that hands control over to the disk in floppy drive two.
    V0.1.0b | Command table is now formatted to handle numerous commands. 
    V0.1.0  | Now you can execute one, yes ONE command. The capability is here, but certainly not formatted to handle a larger table yet.
    V0.0.4  | Input is now properly stored and limited, kernel text can no longer be deleted.
    V0.0.3  | Stack redefined for usage in later variants, input buffer defined.
    V0.0.2  | Implemented F10 as a special key, changing video mode and launching a demo. This will remain untouched until much later.
    V0.0.1b | Reformatted code for attachment to BOOTLOADER.ASM.
    V0.0.1  | Added support for Enter and Backspace keys.
    V0.0.0  | Added basic text functionality.

0x40: [(ES, A000)] Requires VGA Graphics Mode 11h (640x480 1-bit).
    AH-0:[No parameters!], Fills the entirety of 11h VRAM with white. Comparable to a screen clearer.
